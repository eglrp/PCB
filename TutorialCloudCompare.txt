Tutorial of install CloudCompare

Install CMake > 3.0

Install Qt 5.9.0
http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.9/5.9.1/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.9.1.exe

Install visualstudio add-in tool
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools-19123


Download and install PCL libarary for vs 2017
https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases

CMake (step by step)
set QT root: 
D:/Qt/Qt5.9.1/5.9.1/msvc2017_64

Remember CMake using VS2017 win64

Successfully built. build ALL_BUILD, and then INSTALL successful. 

PCL libarary problem, it may be caused by vs compiled libarary (not VS2017).

Now try to compile PCL from source code

1) Boost: Use prebuilt
2) Eigen: Header library, directly copy
3) Flann: 
Download 1.8.4, CMake add Entry:
 
Name:	CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
Type:	STRING
Value:	-gd


In (flann-1.8.4-src\src\cpp\flann\util\serialization.h)
line 92, add:

#ifdef _MSC_VER
BASIC_TYPE_SERIALIZER( unsigned __int64 );
#endif

4) OpenNI2: installed
5) QHULL: Download from Github.
6) VTK:
https://www.vtk.org/download/
https://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Configure_and_Build

enable QT
VTK_Group_Qt:BOOL=ON
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:PATH=C:/path/to/qt-5.2.1-install/5.2.1/msvc2010/bin/qmake.exe

CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

Name:	CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
Type:	STRING
Value:	-gd

Error 1: ‘class vtkUnsignedCharArray’ has no member named ‘InsertNextTupleValue’
https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/issues/2060


Error 2: '_beginthreadex':identifier not found
Reason: Microsoft visual studio has "process.h" file, VTK also has one (include file is not CASE SENSATIVE)
Solution:
1. Remove VTK, failed
2. find process.h path, add this path as YUAN_INCLUDE_DIR using CMAKE gui.
C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2017/Community/SDK/ScopeCppSDK/SDK/include
#Added by Yuan
include_directories(${YUAN_INCLUDE_DIRS})
Change the headerfile: <crtf/process.h>

Error 3: disable libUSB. 

Error 4: project pcl_surface has external linking error because of QHULL. 
Recompile QHULL, manully add qhullstatic_d.lib into pcl_surface project.

Add bin files into system Path
D:\Yuan\pcl-3rdparty\VTK\bin
D:\Yuan\pcl-3rdparty\Flann\bin
D:\Yuan\pcl-3rdparty\QHull\bin
D:\PCL\bin
C:\Program Files\OpenNI2\Tools



After PCL is installed, configure cloudcompare in CMAKE, 
add BOOST_ROOT in CMAKE
add YUAN_INCLUDE_DIRS in CMAKE
C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2017/Community/SDK/ScopeCppSDK/SDK/include

Build CloudCompare, Success!

0430:
needs to incoporate CGAL library. 

Build CGAL: download source code from CGAL website.
https://www.cgal.org/download/windows.html#GeneralPrerequisites
Based on reference, go to github to download CGAL-4.11-Setup.exe (which only contains src and auxiliary files--- precompiled gmp)
https://blog.csdn.net/eloudy/article/details/78061701

Don't add postfix '-gd' since it's already there.
